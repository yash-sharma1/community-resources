## Method Binding Utilities

* **React-Autobind**\
  [https://github.com/cassiozen/React-autobind](https://github.com/cassiozen/React-autobind)\
  A useful utility to bind class methods. A good compromise - makes binding explicit, but removes repetition.
* **react-bind-decorator**\
  [https://github.com/zackargyle/react-bind-decorator](https://github.com/zackargyle/react-bind-decorator)\
  Another autobinding approach, intended to be fast and performant.
* **react-class-binder**\
  [https://github.com/Klathmon/react-class-binder](https://github.com/Klathmon/react-class-binder)\
  [https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/4p0ytu/i\_made\_a\_small\_package\_to\_easily\_autobind\_this\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/4p0ytu/i\_made\_a\_small\_package\_to\_easily\_autobind\_this\_in/)\
  Automatically bind methods defined in a React component using the ES2015 class syntax (similar to how React.createClass works). The Reddit comments have discussion on some differences between the various libs that implement autobinding.

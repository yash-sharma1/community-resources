  A reminder to avoid the built-in Array functions that mutate the array, with snippets demonstrating alernative immutable functionality
* **Javascript Array: slice vs splice**\
  [https://ariya.io/2014/02/javascript-array-slice-vs-splice](https://ariya.io/2014/02/javascript-array-slice-vs-splice)\

* **Immutable Data from Scratch**\
  [https://ryanfunduk.com/articles/immutable-data-from-scratch/](https://ryanfunduk.com/articles/immutable-data-from-scratch/)\
  Demonstrates building up an immutable update utility library similar to React's Update Addons
* **Immutable Objects with `Object.freeze`**\

* **Immutability in Javascript**\
  [http://www.sitepoint.com/immutability-javascript/](http://www.sitepoint.com/immutability-javascript/)\
  Describes a couple basic concepts of immutable data in Javascript, and how the Immutable.js library can be used for those concepts.
* **Immutable Data Structures and Javascript**\
  [http://jlongster.com/Using-Immutable-Data-Structures-in-JavaScript](http://jlongster.com/Using-Immutable-Data-Structures-in-JavaScript)\
  In-depth article covering the value of immutable data, and two common JS libraries
